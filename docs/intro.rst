Getting Started
---------------

The purpose of this guide is to provide a sampling of hands-on exercises to better understand the subjects outlined in the 201-TMOS Administration Exam Blueprint.

The Ravello F5 vLab (virtual lab environment) is an F5-community supported tool. Please DO NOT contact F5 Support for assistance with the vlab. For help with the setup of the vLab or running a demonstration, you should contact your F5 Channel Account Manager (CAM).

To set up your own lab environment on your own platform.
Please refer to vLab Setup and Configuration Guide for detailed instructions. This guide is included in the Partner_vLab_Package on https://downloads.f5.com.

.. NOTE::
	 All work for this lab will be performed exclusively from the lab
	 jumphost. No installation or interaction with your local system is
	 required.
